**Work Done**
* Designed a CAD model using SolidWorks
* Redesigned the legs in RRR configuration
* Conducted Inverse Kinematic Analysis to obtain the Transformation Matrix
* Obtained the Stable Workspace of the Robot by plotting the area covered by the centroid of the Next Swing Leg and the Support Polygon using MATLAB
* Incorporated pitch, yaw and roll, as well as various gaits, including trot, canter and pace

_Helped me develop my leadership, CAD and CAE skills, and also gain hands-on experience in Robotics._
