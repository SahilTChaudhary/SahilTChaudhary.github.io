**Work Done**
* Designed the CAD model using Fusion 360
* Calculated the applied Impulse Load and Failure Load, and conducted Static Structural Analysis using Ansys
* Designed a folding mechanism for the treadmill by folding the deck in half for easy storage
* The Treadmill is a manual one aimed at walking, with an inclination of 15Â° to facilitate easy movement
* The Treadmill can withstand a load of 120kg, with a Factor of Safety of 6

_Helped me develop my CAD and CAE skills, and ability to think and solve real world problems._
