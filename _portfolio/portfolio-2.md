**Work Done**
* Designed the CAD model using Fusion 360
* Did Topology Optimization using Fusion 360
* Conducted Static Structural Analysis using Ansys
* Created the .stl files, imported them into Ultimaker Cura, did Slicing and generated the G-Code for 3-D 
* Printing via FDM using PLA as the chosen material
* The arm is limited to the forearm 
* The arm can handle a load of 1kg with a Factor of Safety of 5

_Helped me develop my leadership, CAD and CAE skills, and also learn about Prosthetics as it is an upcoming technology with a huge scope._
