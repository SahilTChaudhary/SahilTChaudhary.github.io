**Work Done**
* Finalized the components and sensors for use in the robot
* Designed a CAD model using Fusion 360
* Calculated the Wheel Motor Torque requirements and the Battery Life
* Conducted a Simulation study in CoppeliaSim (V-REP)
* Programmed the Robot and Sensors using Raspberry Pi 4
* Conducted a Static Stress Analysis on the chassis of the robot using Ansys
* Built a Functional Prototype

_Helped me develop my leadership, CAD and CAE skills, and also gain hands-on experience in Mechatronics._
