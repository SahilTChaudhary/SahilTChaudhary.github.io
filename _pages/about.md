Welcome to my website! This website showcases all my work and projects.

Here is my [Resume](http://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)!

I am Sahil T Chaudhary. I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics and Controls from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India.  I have a passion for Robotics and wish to make a difference and contribute positively to society, and hence aid in the progress of mankind. I am seeking a summer internship in the field of controls and planning.

I am currently working at the Biorobotics Lab in the Robotics Institute at CMU. I am working on Multi-Agent Planning and Controls for a heterogenous convoy of robots. Prior to that, I was incharge of redesigning the Payloads of the robots to reduce weight and centre of gravity, and also improve serviceability. I am also working as a Course Assistant for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Engineers (24787) course in Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, in which I am assisting Professor L. Burak Kara in teaching machine learning and artificial intelligence principles to graduate students. My professional experiences also include working at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India Limited, as a Graduate Engineer Trainee. I was a part of the Corex Operations team, and was deployed in the Control Room. As a Control Room Operations Engineer, my job was to constantly monitor and identify problems that hindered the smooth running of the plant, and collaborate with a team in a hazardous and critical environment, hence ensuring the productivity of the plant. The two broad areas that I had to monitor were Material Handling and the main Process.

I have also participated in several projects during my Bachelor's. The most notable of them is the Re-Sizeable Autonomous Cleaning Robot, in which I was the team lead. We designed a floor cleaning robot that can adjust its size depending on need, hence improving efficiency and reach. Having developed the CAD model, I was incharge of developing the Functional Prototype and programming the robot.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as C++, Python, and MATLAB, and also tools such as Git and ROS. I am also skilled in software like SolidWorks, Ansys, Fusion 360, and CoppeliaSim (V-REP).

Apart from academics, I was a part of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) in my college, by virtue of which I was a part the Republic Day and Independence Day parade contingents in my college. I also participated in a 10km Marathon, which was themed 'Run for Cancer'. Furthermore, I was a part of my high school basketball team. Such activities helped keep my mind and body fit and fine.

My hobbies include travelling, listening to music, watching movies and going for a nice run to maitain my health and fitness. On the technical side of things, I love CAD designing, CAE and programming. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my page. I look forward to any opportunities that come my way!
