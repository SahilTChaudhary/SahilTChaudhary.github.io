Welcome to my website! This website showcases all my work and projects.

Here is my [Resume](http://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)!

I am Sahil T Chaudhary. I am a Mechanical Engineer, and have completed my Bachelors in Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India. I am currently a pursuing my Masters in Science in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics and Controls from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. I have a passion for Robotics and wish to make a difference and contribute positively to society, and hence aid in the progress of mankind.

My professional experiences include working at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India Limited, as a Graduate Engineer Trainee. I was a part of the Corex Operations team, and was deployed in the Control Room. As a Control Room Operations Engineer, my job was to constantly monitor and identify problems that hindered the smooth running of the plant, hence ensuring productivity of the plant. The two broad areas that I had to monitor were Material Handling, and the main Process. I was also an Intern at Maruti Suzuki India Limited, as part of which I was a trainee in Energy Auditing and Management, and learnt about improving the efficiencies of various systems of a plant, like Boilers. 

I have also participated in several projects during my Bachelor's. The most notable of them is the Re-Sizeable Autonomous Cleaning Robot, in which I was the team lead. We designed a floor cleaning robot that can adjust its size depending on need, hence improving efficiency and reach. Having developed the CAD model, I was incharge of developing the Functional Prototype and programming the robot.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, MATLAB and R. I am also skilled in tools like SolidWorks, Ansys, Fusion 360, CopprliaSim (V-REP) and Git.

Apart from academics, I was a part of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) in my college, by virtue of which I was a part the Republic Day and Independence Day parade contingents in my college. I also participated in a 10km Marathon, which was themed 'Run for Cancer'. Furthermore, I was a part of my high school basketball team. Such activities helped keep my mind and body fit and fine.

My father is an Army Officer in the Indian Army, by virtue of which I have gained great exposure to the different cultures and landscapes of India. Such a lifestyle of constant change has also made me extremely flexible and adaptable. My mother is a homemaker.

My hobbies include travelling, listening to music, watching movies and going for a nice run to maitain my health and fitness. On the technical side of things, I love CAD designing, CAE and programming. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my page. I look forward to any opportunities that come my way!
