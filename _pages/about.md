Welcome to my website! This website showcases all my work and projects.

Here is my [Resume](http://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)!

I am Sahil Chaudhary. I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics and Controls from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India.  I have a passion for Robotics and wish to make a difference and contribute positively to society, and hence aid in the progress of mankind. I am seeking full-time roles in Robotics Software, Controls and Planning.

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Biorobotics Lab at CMU. Here, I am working on developing algorithms and features for **Multi-Agent Planning and Controls for a heterogenous system of robots, along with Comms-Aware Planning**. I have developed an algorithm that uses a modified Max-Min Spanning Tree to ensure that robots within a network **maintain communication fidelity**, and also to ensure that the robots can extend their reach as far as possible (given the limitations of the network itself) before going out of comms. I have developed a **Decentralized Heterogenous Convoy framework** to coordinate RC cars and Quadrupeds (which can easily be extended to other heterogenous platforms), and also an algorithm to make robots meet up at their nearest common intersection to accomplish further mission objectives, all done autonomously. I have also worked on and made improvements to the Local Planner governing the robots. Furthermore, I have designed a **modular payload for the robots with serviceability in mind**.

I have also worked as a Course Assistant for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Engineers (24787) course in Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, in which I assisted Professor L. Burak Kara in teaching machine learning and artificial intelligence principles to graduate students. 
My professional experiences also include working at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India Limited, as a Graduate Engineer Trainee.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as **C++ and Python, and also tools such as Git and ROS**. I also have experience in working with simulation platforms like **Gazebo, RViz and CoppeliaSim (V-REP)**. Furthermore, I am skilled in CAD software like **SolidWorks, Ansys and Fusion 360**.

Thank you for taking the time to read my page. I look forward to any opportunities that come my way!
