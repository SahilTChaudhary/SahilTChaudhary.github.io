Welcome to my website!

Here is my [Resume](http://sahiltchaudhary.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)!

I am Sahil Chaudhary, a **Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA**. My specialization lies in the vast and exciting field of **Robotics**. In particular, I am interested in all things at the intersection of **Controls amd Planning**, particularly for autonomous systems and field robotics. I invite you to explore my work and experiences that have shaped and defined my passion for the field.

I wish to make a difference and contribute positively to society, and hence aid in the progress of mankind. **I am seeking full-time roles in Robotics Software, Controls and Planning**.

<h2>My Skillset</h2>
  * <b>Programming Languages:</b> C++, Python, MATLAB, Julia
  * <b>Tools and Software:</b> ROS, Git, Linux, Gazebo, Matplotlib, PyTorch, NumPy, SKLearn, Docker, SolidWorks, Ansys, Fusion 360
  * <b>Knowledge Areas:</b> Controls, Planning, SLAM, Robot Dynamics, Machine Learning, CAD, Mechanical Design, 3-D Printing 

<h2>My Work and Projects</h2>

* As a **Graduate Research Assistant in the Biorobotics Lab at CMU**, I am working on developing algorithms and features for **Multi-Agent Planning and Controls for a heterogenous system of robots, along with Comms-Aware Planning**.

  * I have developed an algorithm that uses a modified Max-Min Spanning Tree to ensure that robots within a network **maintain communication fidelity**, and also to ensure that the robots can extend their reach as far as possible (given the limitations of the network itself) before going out of comms. 
  * I have developed a **Decentralized Heterogenous Convoy framework** to coordinate RC cars and Quadrupeds (which can easily be extended to other heterogenous platforms), and also an algorithm to make robots meet up at their nearest common intersection to accomplish further mission objectives, all done autonomously. 
  * I have also worked on and made improvements to the Local Planner governing the robots. Furthermore, I have designed a **modular payload for the robots with serviceability in mind**.

* My prior work and professional experiences include:

  * Working as a **Course Assistant for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Engineers (24787) course in Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering**, in which I assisted Professor L. Burak Kara in teaching machine learning and artificial intelligence principles to graduate students.
  * Working at **ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India Limited, as a Graduate Engineer Trainee**.

* My coursework and projects cover a wide variety of domains, contributing to my development as a holistic Robotics Engineer. Here are some of the domains in which my knowledge and expertise lies:

  * <b>Controls:</b> PID, LQR, MPC, and MPPI controllers, and have also worked on non-linear traj-opt methods like iLQR.
  * <b>Planning:</b> A* and its variants, D*, PRM, RRT and its variants, and have hence developed a keen understanding of these algorithms.
Other domains include:
  * <b>SLAM:</b> State estimation methods like EKF, and LiDAR-IMU time syncing.
  * <b>Machine Learning:</b> Traditional supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and implementation using PyTorch and SKLearn libraries.
  * <b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> Value-Based and Policy-Based RL algorithms, and deployment of a PPO-agent to play a game of Pinball!
  * <b>Hardware:</b> Worked on several hardware projects over the ears, including designing payloads for robots. I am a MechE afterall!

Thank you for taking the time to go through my portfolio. I look forward to any opportunities that come my way!
