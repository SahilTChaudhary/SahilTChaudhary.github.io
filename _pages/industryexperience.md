* <h2>Biorobotics Lab, Pittsburgh, PA</h2>
  <h3>Graduate Research Assistant (August 2023 - Present)</h3>
  * <b>Core Skills:</b> C++, Python, ROS, Git, Linux, Gazebo, SolidWorks
  * <h3>Comms-Aware Planning</h3>
    *	Developed a novel algorithm to maintain communication fidelity among robots in a convoy
    *	Formulated a modified Max-Min Spanning Tree to optimize the distance the robots travel before peeling off
    * Validated the algorithm through successful deployment on robots using proprietary radios
  * <h3>Convoy</h3>
    *	Developed a Heterogenous Convoy framework comprising RC Cars and Quadruped Robots
    *	Designed an algorithm enabling rendezvous at intersections and coordinated return as a convoy
  * <h3>Payload Redesign</h3>
    *	Redesigned the payload of RC Cars and Quadruped Robots that are part of a heterogenous convoy to improve performance and serviceability
    * Made the payload 10% lighter, more compact, and easily accessible to ensure serviceability by using Delrin and making the payload modular
    * Reduced Centre of Gravity by 15% by decreasing the height of the payload, hence improving cornering performance of the RC cars
    * Incorporated sensors, including LiDAR, IMU, and two cameras, along with the on-board computer, motor controller, and circuit boards while ensuring optimal field of view and sensor placement
